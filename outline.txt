Chapter 1
- We meet Nick, Tom, Daisy and Jordan
-change now

In the world of East Egg, alluring appearances serve to cover 
unattractive realities. The marriage of Tom and Daisy Buchanan
 seems menaced by a quiet desperation beneath its pleasant surface.
  Unlike Nick, Tom is arrogant and dishonest, advancing racist
   arguments at dinner and carrying on relatively public love affairs.
    Daisy, on the other hand, tries hard to be shallow, even going 
    so far as to say she hopes her baby daughter will turn out to 
    be a fool, because women live best as beautiful fools. Jordan 
    Baker furthers the sense of sophisticated fatigue hanging over 
    East Egg: her cynicism, boredom, and dishonesty are at sharp 
    odds with her wealth and beauty. As with the Buchanans’ marriage, 
    Jordan’s surface glamour covers up an inner emptiness.
